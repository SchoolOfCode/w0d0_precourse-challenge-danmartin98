# FreeCodeCamp Tribute page - Martin Luther King

### Why did I choose MLK?
I chose martin Luther king because I already knew a lot about him, so I thought this would make things easier when writing the code as I could get into a rhythm without having to keep stopping.

### How did I find it?
* It was motivating to see progress being made
* The HTML started to click
* Extremely useful putting the theory into practice
* Excited to try more projects to build on the ‘muscle memory’ aspect of coding

### What did I struggle with?
* CSS was more difficult than HTML
* There are still parts that haven’t clicked yet
* Useful doing this task to see which area's I need to focus on
